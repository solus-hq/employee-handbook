					<h2 class="display-6">Flexible working hours</h2>

					<p>
						Team members are free to choose the hours that work best for them, within 7am-7pm on weekdays. To ensure
						there is ample overlapping time for teammates to work together, the hours you choose should include the
						hours of 10am-4pm (with the exception of a reasonable lunch break).
					</p>

					<p>
						The hours you work can change day-by-day, and you don’t need to let anyone know when you plan to arrive or
						leave each day (as long as it’s within the windows described above). Need to come in later one day and
						earlier the next? Go for it!
					</p>

					<p>
						Employees generally still have access to the office outside of the 7-7 working window, but working outside
						of these hours should be reserved for extreme circumstances (like a software outage that needs immediate
						attention). However, feel free to enjoy the games or game tables at the office anytime with friends +
						family!
