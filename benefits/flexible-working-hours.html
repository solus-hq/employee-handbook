					<h2>Flexible working hours</h2>

					<p>
						Team members are free to choose the hours that work best for them,
						within 7am-7pm on weekdays. To ensure there is ample overlapping
						time for teammates to work together, the hours you choose should
						include the hours of 10am-4pm (with the exception of a reasonable
						lunch break).
					</p>

					<p>
						The hours you work can change day-by-day, and you don’t need to let
						anyone know when you plan to arrive or leave each day (as long as
						it’s within the windows described above). Need to come in later one
						day and earlier the next? Go for it!
					</p>

					<p>
						Employees generally still have access to the office outside of the
						7-7 working window, but working outside of these hours should be
						reserved for extreme circumstances (like a software outage that
						needs immediate attention). However, feel free to enjoy the games or
						game tables at the office anytime with friends + family!
					</p>
