					<h2>New parent leave</h2>

					<p>
						All full-time employees, regardless of gender, can opt to take up to
						12 weeks of unpaid new parent leave. This time is typically used for
						the new parent to welcome the new child or children into their home,
						but can also be used near the end of pregnancy for medical reasons.
					</p>

					<h5>How it works</h5>

					<p>
						An employee is considered a new parent four weeks before the birth
						of a biological child, upon adoption of a child, or upon receiving a
						foster child. The 12 weeks must be used within 1 year of the birth,
						adoption, or placement (respectively) of the new child. The leave
						can be taken consecutively or intermittently as needed. During the
						12 weeks, you will not receive your usual salary, but our health
						reimbursement arrangement will continue unaffected.
					</p>

					<h5>How to use</h5>

					<p>
						New parent leave can be used by notifying the person you report to
						as early as reasonably possible and gaining approval. Under normal
						circumstances, at least several weeks notice is expected. New parent
						leave can be taken in whole-day increments.
					</p>
