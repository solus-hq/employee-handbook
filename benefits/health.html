					<h2>Health</h2>

					<p>
						We realize that every employee is unique, so we’ve opted to provide
						all full-time employees with what’s known as a health reimbursement
						arrangement (HRA). Why? Because they’re awesome! In a nutshell, an
						HRA uses tax-free, 100% company provided funds to reimburse you for
						medical expenses incurred by you and your family. We primarily
						intend for it to cover monthly premiums, but it can also be used to
						reimburse a variety of out-of-pocket expenses.
					</p>

					<h5>What makes it so awesome?</h5>

					<p>Glad you asked, because there’s a lot of benefits.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Flexibility.</strong> You have complete freedom to choose
							the coverage you need for you and your family. You’re free to
							choose the perfect medical plan option with the right combination
							of deductibles, coverage, premiums, etc. You can also supplement
							that with dental, vision, or prescription insurance plans
							according to your needs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cost savings.</strong> Simply put, it’s generally cheaper
							for someone to buy plans on the competitive individual market than
							it is for a company to buy the same plans for their employees.
							Plus, companies don’t need to waste money providing coverage to
							all employees that only some employees need.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Covers out-of-pocket expenses.</strong> Unlike typical
							plans, HRAs can completely reimburse you for a multitude of other
							medical expenses, including coinsurance, copayments, deductibles,
							shots, eyeglasses, and quite a bit more.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Peace of mind.</strong> Since you purchase plans on the
							individual market, you won’t lose coverage if your employment
							ends.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>How it works</h5>

					<p>
						Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements were
						enacted by Congress via the 21st Century Cures Act, and the
						regulations established there govern much of how our company’s HRA
						works. Below are the monthly reimbursement contributions we’ve
						elected to provide to every full-time employee:
					</p>

					<table class="table">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Classification</th>
								<th>Monthly contribution</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>

						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Single employee
									<em style="font-size: 85%; color: #777"
										>(no spouse or dependents)</em
									>
								</td>
								<td>$400/mo</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>
									Employee with family
									<em style="font-size: 85%; color: #777"
										>(has spouse and/or dependents)</em
									>
								</td>
								<td>$800/mo</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p>
						At the beginning of each month, our company will contribute the
						appropriate amount to each employee’s HRA plan. Unused funds
						rollover from month-to-month, but will not rollover from one plan
						year to the next.
					</p>

					<h5>How to use the funds</h5>

					<p>
						You’ll be mailed a debit card from our HRA provider, which you can
						use to pay for many types of medical expenses in person. It usually
						works at doctor’s offices and places like CVS or Walgreens.
					</p>

					<p>
						For online purchases, premium payments, or if you simply forgot to
						use your debit card, you can be reimbursed by submitting claims
						directly to our HRA provider. Reimbursements usually arrive in about
						a week or two.
					</p>

					<h5>Eligible expenses</h5>

					<p>
						For a complete list of eligible expenses, see the corresponding
						Google Sheet in the Google Drive folder shared with all employees.
						The spreadsheet also notes which claims may need supplemental
						documentation.
					</p>

					<p>
						It’s important to note that an HRA cannot be used to reimburse
						premiums for insurance plans not purchased on the individual market
						(e.g., a plan provided through another employer). The IRS considers
						this double dipping.
