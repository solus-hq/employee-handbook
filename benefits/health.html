					<h2>Health</h2>

					<p>
						We offer a variety of employer-sponsored health plans with company
						contributions. We also offer vision and dental plans, along with
						HSAs and FSAs. The process of selecting and managing plans is made
						easy and seamless by our payroll provider.
					</p>

					<h5>HSAs and FSAs</h5>

					<p>
						We offer HSAs and FSAs as an optional way to reduce your taxes for
						many types of health expenses. FSAs can be used with any of the
						above health plans, while HSAs can only be used with the health
						plans that meet the requirements for a “High Deductible Health Plan”
						(HDHP).
					</p>

					<h5>Company contribution</h5>

					<p>
						Our company will contribute 50% of the cost of the employee’s base
						health plan premium, toward whichever of the above health plans the
						employee chooses. Here’s a simplified example of what that looks
						like:
					</p>

					<table class="table">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th></th>
								<th>Plan A (base)</th>
								<th>Plan B</th>
								<th>Plan C</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>

						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td><strong>Employee premium</strong></td>
								<td>$300</td>
								<td>$400</td>
								<td>$500</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td><strong>Company contribution</strong></td>
								<td>$150</td>
								<td>$150</td>
								<td>$150</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td><strong>Employee contribution</strong></td>
								<td>$150</td>
								<td>$250</td>
								<td>$350</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p>
						There is no company contribution toward dental premiums, vision
						premiums, FSAs, or HSAs.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em
							>We’ve established a plan to slowly phase out extra compensation
							for team members with a spouse and/or dependents (a relic of an
							earlier health benefit arrangement). As such, for 2022, we’re
							contributing 100% of the cost of each non-employee’s base health
							plan premium. This will be followed by 50% in 2023 and 0% in all
							future years.</em
						>
					</p>

					<h5>Enrollment</h5>

					<p>
						For new team members, coverage can typically begin as early as the
						next 1st of the month following your hire date. The exception to
						this is, if you’re hired <em>on</em> the 1st of a month, dental and
						vision plans can begin the same day.
					</p>

					<p>
						Existing team members will receive communications each year
						regarding the annual open enrollment period (the period when changes
						can be made to health benefits). If you have a “qualifying life
						event,” team members can notify our payroll provider, and they can
						assist with making changes to health benefits during a special
						enrollment period.
					</p>

					<h5>Premium pricing</h5>

					<p>
						Our plans use ”member-level” premiums, where each covered person’s
						premium is based on their age and ZIP code. This is different than
						”composite” premiums, where employees are placed into one of four
						categories (employee only, employee + spouse, employee + dependents,
						employee + spouse + dependents). Composite premiums are more common
						with large employers but have several shortcomings, especially with
						small- to mid-sized employers.
					</p>

					<h5>FAQs</h5>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>
								Can a family mix-and-match the above health plans?
							</strong>
							Unfortunately, no. Family members must use the same plan the
							employee chooses, or opt for coverage from elsewhere.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Can an employee decline health coverage?</strong> Yes, but
							proof-of-coverage from a different health plan must be provided.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>
								If an employee declines health coverage, can their spouse and/or
								dependents still receive coverage?
							</strong>
							Unfortunately, no. Since the employee is the primary on the plan,
							for their spouse and/or dependents to receive coverage through our
							company, the employee cannot decline coverage.
