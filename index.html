			Heads up! Our entire team is temporarily working remotely due to COVID-19, so some of the policies below have been adapted or are not currently applicable. Some, like the policy regarding working remotely, are likely to grow more flexible post-pandemic.

				This employee handbook is designed to answer questions that current and prospective employees may have about our employment policies, benefits, perks, hiring process, office policies, etc. The content within applies to Sparksuite and its subsidiaries. We’ve posted this publicly to promote a culture of transparency and clarity.<br><br>
				
				We’ve also <a href="https://github.com/sparksuite/employee-handbook">open sourced this on GitHub</a> to allow others to contribute and to track the changes we’ve made to these policies over time. We’ve given it a flexible license so other companies can benefit from our research and work.<br><br>
				
				If you would like to make a contribution, pull requests on GitHub are encouraged! We’d also love to answer any questions or comments you may have, so feel free to reach out.<br><br>
