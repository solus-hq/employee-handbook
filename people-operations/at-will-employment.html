					<p>
						Your employment is at-will. This means that you are free to terminate your employment at any time, with or
						without cause and the company has a right to terminate your employment at any time as well, with or without
						cause. No one in the company other than the CEO has the authority to alter your at-will status or to enter
						into any agreement for employment for a specified period of time or to make any agreement contrary to this
						policy. Only the CEO may do so, and only in a written agreement signed by both the CEO and you.
