					<h2>Code of conduct</h2>

					<p>
						As a company, we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards of
						ethical conduct; however, this wouldn’t be possible without the
						people who make up our team believing in and standing behind these
						same ideals. To that end, we’ve developed this Code of Conduct to
						demonstrate our company values and to guide employees toward
						conducting themselves in an honorable way.
					</p>

					<p>
						This code has been written using broad language that demonstrates
						the expectations we have for employees in general since it would be
						impossible to comment on every foreseeable situation. We fully
						expect employees to use their best judgment in all situations to
						uphold these values and to encourage other team members to do the
						same.
					</p>

					<h5>Who does this code apply to?</h5>

					<p>
						We expect all employees and board members to abide by this Code of
						Conduct. Although this code has been written with employees and
						board members in mind, we also expect contractors and consultants to
						follow this code as well.
					</p>

					<h5>When does this apply?</h5>

					<p>
						This code is critical in the office and whenever you are
						representing our company. However, we believe it’s reasonable for
						employees to uphold these values in their personal lives too. This
						is especially important on social media since your employment is
						often listed and your statements and actions can be easily viewed by
						millions.
					</p>

					<h5>Questions and concerns</h5>

					<p>
						Immediately report concerns to the person you report to (unless that
						person is the target of your concern, in which case you should
						report your concern to the next in rank). If you have a question
						about the Code of Conduct, please direct it to the person you report
						to.
					</p>

					<h5>I. Communication</h5>

					<p>
						When communicating in any form, always maintain a level of
						professionalism and carefulness so as to represent yourself and our
						company in a positive light. This includes all communication,
						whether internal or external. Here are some expectations:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Always encourage, support, and build up teammates; never tear
							others down.
						</li>
						<li>Be honest at all times; do not try to spin the truth.</li>
						<li>Be respectful of others, their ideas, and their beliefs.</li>
						<li>Speak kindly; avoid rude, sharp, harsh, or mean comments.</li>
						<li>Even during challenging circumstances, remain calm.</li>
						<li>
							Never make sexist, racist, crude, or other offensive jokes or
							comments.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>II. Integrity</h5>

					<p>
						Consistently act with the highest degree of integrity possible. This
						means making decisions and producing work that you can be proud of,
						no matter the situation. Be honest and open with others, and foster
						an environment where others can be comfortable doing the same.
					</p>

					<p>
						Additionally, integrity involves taking personal responsibility for
						your actions and decisions. Nobody is perfect, so when you make
						mistakes, own up to them. You’ll earn more respect by doing so than
						by covering up the truth.
					</p>

					<h5>III. Preserve confidentiality</h5>

					<p>
						This subject is already covered by the PIIAA, but we wanted to touch
						on it here as well. As an employee of our company, you will almost
						certainly be privy to information not known to the general public.
						This may include upcoming features, new business models, growth
						strategies, business deals in-the-works, hiring decisions, business
						metrics, intellectual property, and so on. Leaking such information
						can be harmful and costly to our company. We expect all employees to
						be exceedingly careful to safeguard confidential information at all
						times.
					</p>

					<h5>IV. Conflicts of interest</h5>

					<p>
						As an employee of our company, you have an obligation to always do
						what’s best for our company and our users. When you are in a
						situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a
						personal benefit for you, your friends, or your family at the
						expense of our company or our users, you may be faced with a
						conflict of interest. You should take care to avoid conflicts of
						interest and circumstances that reasonably present the appearance of
						a conflict.
					</p>

					<h5>V. Inclusiveness</h5>

					<p>
						Always work to create an inclusive environment for everyone,
						regardless of race, color, religion, veteran status, national
						origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, gender, age, marital status,
						parental status, mental or physical disability, medical condition,
						physical appearance, political affiliation, or any other
						characteristics protected by law.
					</p>

					<h5>VI. Harassment</h5>

					<p>
						We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. Harassment
						includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes
						above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
						stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against
						reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
						inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
						Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome
						by anyone other than the person being harassed.
					</p>

					<h5>VII. Retaliation</h5>

					<p>
						We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any employee who
						makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If
						you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative
						treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint,
						report the concern immediately.
