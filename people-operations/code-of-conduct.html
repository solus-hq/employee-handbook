					<h2 class="display-6">Code of conduct</h2>

					<p>
						As a company, we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards of ethical conduct; however, this wouldn’t
						be possible without the people who make up our team believing in and standing behind these same ideals. To
						that end, we’ve developed this Code of Conduct to demonstrate our company values and to guide employees
						toward conducting themselves in an honorable way.
					</p>

					<p>
						This code has been written using broad language that demonstrates the expectations we have for employees in
						general since it would be impossible to comment on every foreseeable situation. We fully expect employees to
						use their best judgment in all situations to uphold these values and to encourage other team members to do
						the same.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">Who does this code apply to?</h5>

					<p>
						We expect all employees and board members to abide by this Code of Conduct. Although this code has been
						written with employees and board members in mind, we also expect contractors and consultants to follow this
						code as well.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">When does this apply?</h5>

					<p>
						This code is critical in the office and whenever you are representing our company. However, we believe it’s
						reasonable for employees to uphold these values in their personal lives too. This is especially important on
						social media since your employment is often listed and your statements and actions can be easily viewed by
						millions.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">Questions and concerns</h5>

					<p>
						Immediately report concerns to the person you report to (unless that person is the target of your concern,
						in which case you should report your concern to the next in rank). If you have a question about the Code of
						Conduct, please direct it to the person you report to.
					</p>

					<hr class="my-4" />

					<h5 class="pt-2">I. Communication</h5>

					<p>
						When communicating in any form, always maintain a level of professionalism and carefulness so as to
						represent yourself and our company in a positive light. This includes all communication, whether internal or
						external. Here are some expectations:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Always encourage, support, and build up teammates; never tear others down.</li>
						<li>Be honest at all times; do not try to spin the truth.</li>
						<li>Be respectful of others, their ideas, and their beliefs.</li>
						<li>Speak kindly; avoid rude, sharp, harsh, or mean comments.</li>
						<li>Even during challenging circumstances, remain calm.</li>
						<li>Never make sexist, racist, crude, or other offensive jokes or comments.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="pt-2">II. Integrity</h5>

					<p>
						Consistently act with the highest degree of integrity possible. This means making decisions and producing
						work that you can be proud of, no matter the situation. Be honest and open with others, and foster an
						environment where others can be comfortable doing the same.
					</p>

					<p>
						Additionally, integrity involves taking personal responsibility for your actions and decisions. Nobody is
						perfect, so when you make mistakes, own up to them. You’ll earn more respect by doing so than by covering up
						the truth.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">III. Preserve confidentiality</h5>

					<p>
						This subject is already covered by the PIIAA, but we wanted to touch on it here as well. As an employee of
						our company, you will almost certainly be privy to information not known to the general public. This may
						include upcoming features, new business models, growth strategies, business deals in-the-works, hiring
						decisions, business metrics, intellectual property, and so on. Leaking such information can be harmful and
						costly to our company. We expect all employees to be exceedingly careful to safeguard confidential
						information at all times.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">IV. Conflicts of interest</h5>

					<p>
						As an employee of our company, you have an obligation to always do what’s best for our company and our
						users. When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit
						for you, your friends, or your family at the expense of our company or our users, you may be faced with a
						conflict of interest. You should take care to avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably
						present the appearance of a conflict.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">V. Inclusiveness</h5>

					<p>
						Always work to create an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, veteran
						status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, gender, age, marital status, parental status, mental or
						physical disability, medical condition, physical appearance, political affiliation, or any other
						characteristics protected by law.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">VI. Harassment</h5>

					<p>
						We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related
						to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
						following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or
						other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be
						recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.
					</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">VII. Retaliation</h5>

					<p>
						We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any employee who makes a good faith complaint or
						participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative
						treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the concern immediately.
