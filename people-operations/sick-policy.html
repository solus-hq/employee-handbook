					<p>
						If you’re feeling under the weather, you should first know that we hope you feel better soon! If you are
						experiencing symptoms of a contagious disease, we ask that you either take time off or work from home until
						at least 24 hours after those alleviate. Note: our
						<a href="../benefits/flexible-remote-work.html">remote work policy</a> would still apply if you choose to
						work from home. In particular, your symptoms should not prevent you from being as productive as when you’re
						feeling well; if they do, please take time off instead.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you test positive for a contagious disease but are not experiencing symptoms, we ask that you work from
						home for as long as the CDC recommends for that particular disease. Out of courtesy to others, if you have
						reason to suspect that you’ve had significant exposure to a testable contagious disease (e.g., COVID-19, the
						flu, strep throat, etc.), we recommend scheduling a test.
