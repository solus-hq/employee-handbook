					<h2>Employee privacy</h2>

					<p>
						Before diving into this section, it’s important to realize that we
						place substantial trust in our employees and therefore respect
						employee privacy as much as we can.
					</p>

					<p>
						To protect our company, though, we need to make it clear that
						employees do not have a right to privacy within the workplace. This
						includes our offices, any company owned property that you use (e.g.,
						desk, storage, laptop, etc.), company provided online accounts and
						services (e.g., email, code repositories, file sharing services,
						etc.), and other items of this nature. With this in mind, we reserve
						the right to search these at any time, without warning, to ensure
						compliance with our policies, including those that cover employee
						safety, workplace violence, harassment, theft, and possession of
						prohibited items.
					</p>

					<h5>Email and internet privacy</h5>

					<p>
						Company provided email and internet are not being actively monitored
						by anyone, but because they are company resources that are managed
						according to company policy, you should not expect privacy from
						either. Our company has both the ability and the right to look at
						employee usage for both in order to protect employee safety and
						wellbeing, as well as company property and interests.
					</p>

					<p>
						Email messages (including attachments) sent and received from a
						company email address are the property of our company. We reserve
						the right to access, monitor, read, and/or copy email messages at
						any time, for any reason. You should not expect privacy for any
						email you send using your company email, including messages that you
						consider to be personal or label with a designation such as
						"Personal" or "Private."
					</p>

					<p>
						We reserve the right to monitor employee use of the internet at any
						time. You should not expect that your use of the internet—including
						but not limited to the sites you visit, the amount of time you spend
						online, and the communications you have—will be private.
					</p>
