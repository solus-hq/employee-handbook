					<h2>Drugs, alcohol, and weapons</h2>

					<p>
						Our policies regarding drugs, alcohol, and weapons are designed to
						promote a safe and productive work environment for all employees.
						Theyâ€™re also designed to maintain a positive image of our company
						and our employees.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because these are relatively serious subject matters, employees who
						violate any of these policies risk immediate termination and law
						enforcement intervention.
					</p>

					<h5>Drugs</h5>

					<p>
						Under no circumstances may an employee use, buy, sell, or distribute
						illegal drugs, whether at work or not.
					</p>

					<h5>Alcohol</h5>

					<p>
						Alcoholic beverages may be allowed in the office for select
						occasions; in which case, team members are expected to drink
						responsibly and in moderation. However, our office will be presumed
						dry unless otherwise indicated by a team member with authority to
						make exceptions to this policy.
					</p>

					<h5>Weapons</h5>

					<p>
						Weapons are not permitted in the office under any circumstances,
						with the exception of small pocket knives (blades under 3") and
						mace. Among other things, prohibited weapons include firearms,
						swords, fireworks, explosives, tasers, or anything that could easily
						be construed as a weapon given the environment.
					</p>
